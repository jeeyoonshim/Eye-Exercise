# Eye-Exercise
## Eye Exercise
Exercise in drawing and animating movement with CSS and JavaScript. This exercise helped me get more comfortable with drawing in CSS, and calling elements while working with the DOM.

Hover the mouse over the screen. The eyeball will track the movement of the mouse, moving and following.
